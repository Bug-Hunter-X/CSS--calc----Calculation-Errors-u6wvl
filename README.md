This repository demonstrates a common CSS error involving the `calc()` function. The `bug.css` file shows the incorrect implementation which leads to unexpected behavior, particularly when used within nested elements where parent container dimensions are not explicitly set.  The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates how to correct this by ensuring proper parent sizing or refactoring the `calc()` usage to eliminate dependency on potentially undefined parent dimensions.
