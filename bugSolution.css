To fix this, ensure that the parent element has explicitly defined dimensions (e.g., using `width` or `height`) or adjust the `calc()` expression to be independent of potentially undefined parent dimensions.  Alternatively, consider using a different layout approach such as Flexbox or Grid to manage element sizing more reliably.  For example, if the problem is in a nested element,  you might use Flexbox to explicitly define the size and alignment of the child elements instead of relying solely on `calc()`.  Another solution might be to avoid using `calc()` and use fixed dimensions or percentages in the cases where it's not required to calculate values dynamically.
